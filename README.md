# VaR-of-a-Stock-Portfolio-

Value at Risk (VaR) is a statistic that quantifies the possibke extent of the financial losses within a portofolio over a specific period of time. Risk managers use this measure adn control the level of risk exposure.


Here, I have calculated the VaR for a portfolio of 10 prominent stocks from the Indian stock market namely Adani Ports, Bajaj Finance, Cipla, Dabur, ITC, L&T, Reliance, Sunpharma, TCS and Tech Mahindra.
